# React.js

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Overview

This section covers various aspects of React development:

- Core concepts and fundamentals
- Hooks and their applications
- State management approaches
- Performance optimization techniques
- Advanced patterns and best practices

## Why React?

React offers several advantages for frontend development:

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Declarative**: Design simple views for each state in your application
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently update and render components when data changes
- **One-Way Data Flow**: Makes code more predictable and easier to debug
- **JSX**: Syntax extension that allows you to write HTML in your JavaScript
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support

## Core Concepts

At its core, React is about:

1. **Components**: Reusable, self-contained pieces of your UI
2. **Props**: How components communicate with each other
3. **State**: How components remember things
4. **Rendering**: How components display on screen

## Getting Started

If you're new to React, I recommend starting with the [React documentation](https://react.dev/) and exploring the examples in this section.

I'll be documenting my journey with React, sharing code snippets, common patterns, and lessons learned along the way.
